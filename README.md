This is the guts for a work I've done a year ago. 

I made a few updates and cleaned particular business logic concerning its former application.

Koolcharts is a paid plugin, purchase your license and replace kc/KoolChartLicence.js with your file.

Features:

*It's sharable. The url is clean and short and it can be used to share the same data.

*It's lightweight and modern. Based on HTML5, Bootstrap and uses javascript and KoolCharts libraries for rendering.

*It's secure. Uses prepared statements to access database and other security measures limiting input.
