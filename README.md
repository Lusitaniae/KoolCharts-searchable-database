This is the guts for a work I've done a year ago. 
I'm uploading the code and will be cleaning and updating during this week.

Koolcharts is a paid plugin, purchase your license and replace kc/KoolChartLicence.js with your file.

Features:
*It's sharable. The url is clean and short, it can be sent by email and the other person will see exactly the same data.
*It's lightweight and modern. Based on HTML5, Bootstrap and pure javascript.
*It's secure. Uses prepared statements to access database.
