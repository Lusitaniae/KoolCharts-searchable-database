This is the guts for a work I've done a year ago. 

I made a few updates and cleaned particular business logic concerning its former application.

Koolcharts is a paid plugin, purchase your license and replace kc/KoolChartLicence.js with your file.

**Features:**

* It's sharable. The url is clean and short and it can be used to share the same data.
* It's modern. Based on HTML5, Bootstrap, KoolChart libraries and javascript.
* It's secure. Uses prepared statements to access database and other security measures for input.
